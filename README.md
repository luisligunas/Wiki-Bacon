# Wiki-Bacon

This project aims to replicate sixdegreesofwikipedia.com. This draws from the idea of [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation), wherein any two people in the world are within six social connections (e.g. family, friends, colleagues) from each other.

Instead of people, this project aims to find what the minimum number of clicks is to get from any page on Wikipedia to any other page on Wikipedia. Please note that only articles (i.e. does not include files, images, external links) on the English version of Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/) will be considered for this project.

The main goal of this project is for the code author to be able to learn how to handle the collection and analysis of large amounts of data.
